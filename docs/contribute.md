# Contribute

There are few ways to contribute to Go-Architect, for example:
- The most basic way is reviewing this documentation, it's very common to make mistakes while documenting like: typos, translations, writing errors, etc.
- Trying to install and use the platform in different platforms/architectures.
- Adding tests to the application.
- Adding new feature ideas to the backlog.
- Translating the platform and the documentation to other languages.
- Any other thing that you consider will add value to this project.

For all of this cases you can create a ticket or a Pull-Request in the corresponding Github repository:
- Go-Architect Documentation: https://github.com/go-architect/go-architect.github.io
- Go-Architect Platform: https://github.com/fdaines/go-architect
- Go-Architect Backend Library: https://github.com/fdaines/go-architect-lib
